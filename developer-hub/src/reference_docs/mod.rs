//! # Polkadot SDK Reference Docs.
//!
//! This is the entry point for all reference documents that enhance one's learning experience in
//! the Polkadot SDK.
//!
//! ## What is a "reference document"?
//!
//! First, see [why we use rust-docs for everything](crate#why-rust-docs) and our documentation
//! [principles](crate#principles). We acknowledge that as much of the crucial information should be
//! embedded in the low level rust-docs. Then, high level scenarios should be covered in
//! [`crate::tutorial`]. Finally, we acknowledge that there is a category of information that is:
//!
//! 1. crucial to know.
//! 2. is too high level to be in the rust-doc of any one `type`, `trait` or `fn`.
//! 3. is too low level to be encompassed in a [`crate::tutorial`].
//!
//! We can this class of documents "reference documents". Our goal should be to minimize the number
//! of "reference" docs, as they incur maintenance burden.
//!
//! ## Ownership

//! Every page must have an owner or a list of owners, who are responsible for maintaining the page.
